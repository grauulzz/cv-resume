		\section{Another section}
		
		This page uses the page style \texttt{highlightmain} which shows the highlight bar (gray) and the main part (white background) but omits the header. 
		The default page style is \texttt{headerhighlightmain} with all three elements.
		If you don't want header, nor highlight bar, use page style \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}}.
		\medskip
		Neither main, nor highlight bar must be filled to make this template work.
		It is possible to use a page style with the highlight bar but leave it empty by setting an empty highlightbar \texttt{\textbackslash highlightbar\{\}}.

		\subsection{Subsection 1}
		Demonstrate subsections.
		
		\subsection{Subsection 2}
		Subsection are also bold face but a smaller font then section. They also omit the rule.
